"""
Pydantic models for the Semker Async Message Processing API.

This module defines all the data models used throughout the API using Pydantic
for data validation, serialization, and automatic OpenAPI documentation generation.
All models include comprehensive field descriptions and example values.

Models:
    Message: Input model for message submission requests
    MessageResponse: Response model for message submission confirmations
    UpdateResponse: Response model for processing status updates
    HealthResponse: Response model for health check endpoints

Features:
    - Automatic data validation and type checking
    - JSON schema generation for OpenAPI documentation
    - Example values for interactive documentation
    - Comprehensive field descriptions for developer clarity
